## Hi there 👋

<!--

**Here are some ideas to get you started:**

🙋‍♀️ A short introduction - This organization is about playing around in an organization to test things out. 
🌈 Contribution guidelines - I will draw the guidelines later
👩‍💻 Useful resources - Some resources 
🍿 Fun facts - This looks fun!
🧙 Remember, you can do mighty things with the power of [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)
-->

### This is it, I had to add it to /profile/README.md to make it appear on the main page. 

To create a main page or a README for an organization - create a repo with the name .github and add the file /profile/README.md
This file will de displayed on the main page of the organization.
